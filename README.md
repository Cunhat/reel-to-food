# reel-to-food

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, TanStack Router, Hono, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Router** - File-based routing with full type safety
- **React Native** - Build mobile apps using React
- **Expo** - Tools for React Native development
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **workers** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **Cloudflare D1** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Oxlint** - Oxlint + Oxfmt (linting & formatting)
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) with Drizzle ORM.

Runtime database access uses the Cloudflare `DB` binding from `packages/infra/alchemy.run.ts`. If a local `DATABASE_URL` is present, it is only for database tooling.

Alchemy provisions the D1 database and applies migrations during `dev` and `deploy`.

1. Generate migration files:

```bash
pnpm run db:generate
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
Use the Expo Go app to run the mobile application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## UI Customization

Web and native each own their UI — they do not share a common component package.

### Web (shadcn/ui)

- Design tokens and global styles: `apps/web/src/index.css`
- Primitives: `apps/web/src/components/ui/*`
- Config: `apps/web/components.json`

Add components from `apps/web`:

```bash
cd apps/web && npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table
```

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
```

### Native

Native UI lives under `apps/native` (HeroUI Native / Expo). Do not import web shadcn components there.

## Deployment

### Cloudflare via Alchemy

- Target: web + server
- Dev: pnpm run dev
- Deploy: pnpm run deploy
- Destroy: pnpm run destroy

For more details, see the guide on [Deploying to Cloudflare with Alchemy](https://www.better-t-stack.dev/docs/guides/cloudflare-alchemy).

## Git Hooks and Formatting

- Run checks: `pnpm run check`
